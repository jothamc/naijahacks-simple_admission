# Problem

Gaining admissions into Nigerian universities can be a wearisome process. This can be observed in the many cases where students gain admission to study courses they didn't choose while some don’t gain admissions mostly because they didn't meet theintended course's requirements. One of the major causes of this isthe fact that a lot of students apply for so called “hot courses" in"hot universities", and at the end, a lot of these applications are Rejected.

# Proposed Solution

A WebApp for admission seekers that uses AI to suggest solutions to aspiring/prospective students. The app checks a student’s WAEC/NECO scores and JAMB scores (if available) to suggest Nigerian universities and courses the student is best fitted to. It works both for students who have already obtained results for their JAMB exams and for students who haven’t (in this case, it supplies them a random mix of past questions to get an assumed JAMB score). The app uses both the JAMB scores and the 
WAEC/NECO scores to suggest the best universities the student can apply to (or change to, if they have already written the JAMB exam). The universities suggested will be chosen and sorted usingmany criteria asides the JAMB and WAEC/NECO scores, including distance from student’s permanent residence, parents/guardians or student’s income, etc.

# Proposed Stack

Angular, python, Django, Scikit-learn.

# Benefit

- Ability to refer admission seekers to other close courses in the same university
- Refer admission seekers to other universities for chosen course or other close courses.
- Provide crucial information (like a reminder system) on when universities of interest or in region of interest are holding their post-jamb exams.
- Provide brief introductory information on all courses in all universities so that students can know a bit about what they want to study. 
- Provide crucial information on other things / opportunities the students can engage themselves with should they not gain admission. For instance, fully sponsored vocational training opportunity, online introductory courses to courses of interest, Jupeb programs and their closest locations.
